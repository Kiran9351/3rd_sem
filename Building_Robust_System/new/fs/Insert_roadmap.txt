- To insert new file
	- File information
		- File size
		- File name
		
	- Info. into file metadata
		- File size
		- File name
		- File first block(metablock) (need to find and calculate)
		- Set flag that indicate that FMD block is taken.
		
	- Function for fmd
		- call fmd_functions() (from main())
		- check for blocks availability (from fmd_functions to bitmap.c->check_blocks())
		- find first metablock for fmd (from fmd_functions to bitmap.c->find_first_metablock())
		- find fmd for given file (from fmd_functions() to find_fimd())
	
		- then insert data file name,filesize, metablock no and flag into found fmd
		- Return the fmd into main.
		- use call by address variable to find the bytes till that file fmd.
		
		- Find blocks for acutal data and keep block nos. fmd block no.
		- Using fmd block nos' data write actual data.
		
	
- To insert the data of file
	- seek till the first block of fmd
	- Read the data of first block of fmd into some array.
	- iterate on array
	- Read block no.
	- seek till the block number
	- read the block size amount of data from buffer 
	- write into the block 
	- repeat the process untill all blocks are not written.
